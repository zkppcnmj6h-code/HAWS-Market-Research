# Architect's Brief: Automated Governance Gateway

**Owner:** Software Architect
**Sprint:** S2 (Automation Foundation)
**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Not Started

---

## 1. Objective

Your primary objective is to design and specify the **Automated Governance Gateway (AGG)**, our core CI/CD enforcement mechanism. The AGG will be implemented as a series of mandatory checks within our GitHub Actions workflow. Its purpose is to codify our Leadership Principles and quality standards directly into the development pipeline, making our governance non-negotiable and fully automated. This is a critical piece of infrastructure for scaling our team and maintaining discipline.

## 2. Key Deliverables

You are **Responsible (R)** for producing the following artifact:

1.  **AGG Functional Specification (v1):** A detailed specification document outlining the architecture and logic for the AGG. It must define:
    -   **The Trigger:** The AGG will run on every `pull_request` targeting the `main` branch.
    -   **The Checks (The "Gates"):** A list of mandatory, sequential checks that a PR must pass. The v1 specification must include:
        -   **`haws-verify` Check:** Executes the `bin/haws-verify` script. The PR fails if the script returns a non-zero exit code.
        -   **Brief Link Check:** Parses the PR description to ensure it contains a valid, correctly formatted link to a `.md` brief in the repository. The PR fails if the link is missing or malformed.
        -   **Linting & Formatting Check:** Runs a standard code formatter (e.g., Black for Python) and linter (e.g., Flake8) against the changed files. The PR fails if any file is not correctly formatted.
        -   **Unit Test Check:** Executes the full suite of unit tests. The PR fails if any test fails.
        -   **Security Scan Check:** Integrates an automated dependency scanner (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) to check for known vulnerabilities in any new or updated libraries. The PR fails if a high-severity vulnerability is detected.
    -   **The Output:** A clear, pass/fail status check visible directly on the GitHub Pull Request page. If a check fails, the output must provide a link to the logs and a clear reason for the failure.

## 3. Success Criteria

This brief is considered complete when:

-   The AGG Functional Specification is delivered, covering all required checks and output formats.
-   The specification is sufficiently detailed for the Coder to implement it in GitHub Actions without ambiguity.
-   The specification is approved by the Project Lead.

## 4. Dependencies & Collaborators

-   **You are dependent on:**
    -   The existing `bin/haws-verify` script as a foundational component.
-   **The following roles are dependent on you:**
    -   **The Coder** is blocked until this specification is finalized.
    -   **The entire team's** adherence to our governance model will be enforced by the system you design.

## 5. Repository & Filing

-   **All Deliverables:** `/HAWS_20_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT/Standards/Automation/`
