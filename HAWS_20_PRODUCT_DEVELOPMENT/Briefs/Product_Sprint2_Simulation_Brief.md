# Architect's Brief: Simulation & "Golden Data" Pipeline

**Owner:** Software Architect
**Sprint:** S2 (Product Quality Foundation)
**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** Not Started

---

## 1. Objective

Your primary objective is to design the architecture for the **Simulation & "Golden Data" Pipeline**. This is our core system for ensuring the quality, reliability, and accuracy of our product's risk-scoring engine. The pipeline will allow us to define canonical test scenarios ("golden data"), run them against our system, and automatically validate that the outputs match our expected results. This is the primary mechanism by which we will guarantee product quality and build a trustworthy system.

## 2. Key Deliverables

You are **Responsible (R)** for producing the following artifact:

1.  **Simulation Pipeline Specification (v1):** A detailed specification document outlining the architecture and workflow for this pipeline. It must define:
    -   **The "Golden Data" Format:** The standard format for our simulation files. This will be a version-controlled `.jsonl` file containing a time-ordered sequence of events representing a specific scenario (e.g., `24h_high_risk_construction_day.jsonl`).
    -   **The "Expected Outputs" Format:** The standard format for the corresponding validation files. This will be a version-controlled `.json` file that defines the exact set of alerts (risk score, label, explanation) that the system is expected to generate from the golden data.
    -   **The Pipeline Runner:** The design for a command-line script (e.g., `bin/haws-run-sim`) that takes a golden data file as input, sends its events through the live "Ingest → Score → Serve" API, and captures the resulting alerts.
    -   **The Validation Engine:** The design for a component that compares the actual alerts generated by the pipeline with the "expected outputs" file and produces a clear pass/fail result with a detailed diff if there are any discrepancies.
    -   **CI/CD Integration:** A plan for how this simulation pipeline will be integrated into our GitHub Actions workflow. It must run automatically on any PR that modifies the risk-scoring engine or the data pipeline. A PR that causes a simulation to fail will be automatically blocked from merging.

## 3. Success Criteria

This brief is considered complete when:

-   The Simulation Pipeline Specification is delivered, covering the data formats, runner, validator, and CI/CD integration.
-   The specification is sufficiently detailed for the Coder to implement the full pipeline.
-   The specification is approved by the Project Lead.

## 4. Dependencies & Collaborators

-   **You are dependent on:**
    -   The existing "Ingest → Score → Serve" API as the system under test.
    -   Input from the **Media Researcher** and **Project Lead** to help define the first set of realistic simulation scenarios.
-   **The following roles are dependent on you:**
    -   **The Coder** is blocked until this specification is finalized.
    -   **The venture's product quality and reliability** are directly dependent on the successful implementation of this system.

## 5. Repository & Filing

-   **Golden Data Files:** `/HAWS_20_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT/tests/data/simulations/`
