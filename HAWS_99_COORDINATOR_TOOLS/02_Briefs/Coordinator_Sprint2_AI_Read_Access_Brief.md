**Owner:** Strategic Coordinator  
**Sprint:** S2 (AI Read-Access)  
**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** Not Started

## 1. Objective
Your primary objective is to establish and document the operational and governance procedures required to manage the new **"HAWS AI Access Proxy"** capability. Your work will ensure that this powerful tool is used safely, transparently, and in full compliance with our established principles.

## 2. Key Deliverables
You are **Responsible (R)** for producing the following artifacts:

1. **`ai-access-setup.md`:** A formal Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document detailing the end-to-end process for creating, securely storing in AWS Secrets Manager, and rotating the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) used by the proxy.
2. **Updated Governance Addendum:** A new version of the `Governance_Addendum_AI_Repo_Access.md` file. This update will formally deprecate the manual "sync script" model and ratify the new "API proxy" model as the official method for AI read-access.
3. **Audit Log Review Process:** A documented weekly checklist for reviewing the AI Access Proxy's audit logs. This checklist should guide the reviewer to verify that all requests were for in-scope files and to flag any anomalous activity for immediate escalation to the Project Lead.

## 3. Success Criteria
This brief is considered complete when:
- All three procedural documents are delivered and filed in the repository.
- The procedures are clear, actionable, and provide a complete governance framework for the new capability.
- The documents are approved by the Project Lead.

## 4. Dependencies & Collaborators
- **You are dependent on:**
  - The **Software Architect's** specification for the audit log format.
- **The following roles are dependent on you:**
  - **The entire team's** trust in our AI-assisted workflow depends on the robust governance procedures you establish.
