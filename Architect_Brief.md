# Architect's Brief: Ingest → Score → Serve Sprint

**Owner:** Software Architect  
**Sprint:** S1 (Ingest → Score → Serve)  
**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** Not Started

---

## 1. Objective

Your primary objective is to design and document the technical backbone of the "Ingest → Score → Serve" pipeline. You are the sole owner of the system's technical integrity, scalability, and maintainability. Your work in this sprint will define the foundational architecture upon which all future product development will be built.

## 2. Key Deliverables

You are **Responsible (R)** for producing the following artifacts:

1. **Technical Architecture Diagram:** A clear diagram illustrating the flow of data from event ingest, through the validation and scoring pipeline, to the API endpoints.
2. **Tech Stack Specification:** A document outlining the final decisions on the core technology stack (e.g., database, caching layers, primary libraries) with a brief rationale for each choice.
3. **API Specification (v1):** A finalized, versioned OpenAPI (v3) specification for all v1 endpoints. This is the official contract for all frontend and external services.
4. **Code Review Approvals:** Conduct and approve all pull requests submitted by the Coder for this sprint, ensuring adherence to the architectural standards, best practices, and testing requirements you have set.

*All deliverables must follow HAWS versioning conventions: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_Title_vX`.*

## 3. Success Criteria

This brief is considered complete when:

- The Technical Architecture Diagram is approved by the Project Lead (Aaron Simpson).
- The API Specification is finalized, published to the repository, and validated against the sprint's requirements.
- All of the Coder's sprint-related pull requests have been reviewed and have received your formal approval.
- The final architecture demonstrably supports the initial pilot data load and includes clear extension points for future ML model integration.

## 4. Dependencies & Collaborators

- **You are dependent on:**
  - `Human-Aware_Work_Vision_FINAL.pdf` for strategic context.
  - The Project Lead for final sign-off on the overall architectural approach.

- **The following roles are dependent on you:**
  - **The Coder:** Is blocked until you provide the initial architectural guidance and the finalized API Specification. They will require your ongoing code reviews to merge their work.
  - **The Strategic Coordinator:** Requires your deliverables to be filed correctly to maintain the repository's integrity and track sprint progress.

## 5. Review Cadence & Process

As defined in our Leadership Principles, your work will be reviewed at key milestone points, not through daily check-ins.

- **Initial Architecture Review:** An initial draft of the architecture diagram and tech stack choices should be ready for review by the Project Lead by the end of **Day 3**.
- **API Spec Finalization:** The final, locked version of the OpenAPI spec should be published by the end of **Day 5** to unblock the Coder.
- **Code Reviews:** Ongoing as pull requests are submitted.
- **Final Approval:** All deliverables will be submitted to the Project Lead for final approval at the end of the sprint, facilitated by the Strategic Coordinator.

## 6. Repository & Filing

All artifacts you produce must be stored in their designated locations within the HAWS repository.

- **Architecture Diagram:** `/HAWS_20_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT/01_MVP_Prototypes/Architecture/`
- **Tech Stack Specification:** `/HAWS_20_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT/01_MVP_Prototypes/Architecture/`
- **API Specification:** `/HAWS_20_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT/02_Backend_Scripts/API_Integrations/contracts/`

The **Strategic Coordinator** is responsible for validating that each artifact has been correctly filed and linked in the `Change_Log.xlsx`.
