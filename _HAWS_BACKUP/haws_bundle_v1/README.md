This bundle collects everything you need to work with the current plan:
- Research-backed vision & roadmap (PDF)
- Pilot briefs + runbook (PDF packet with TOC)
- Data ingest schemas + sample simulator stream
- Risk rules configuration (YAML)
- Pilot success tracker (CSV)
- Privacy + compliance templates (US/EU)
- Methods note for analysis (DiD approach)
- Outreach email for pilot partners
- Insurer evidence report template
- Manager Enablement Kit (30/60/90 scaffold)

## Folder Map
- /docs — PDFs and strategic docs
- /schemas — JSON schemas for streams
- /samples — Example JSONL for a short simulated scenario
- /config — Rules and thresholds (YAML)
- /templates — Consent, anonymization, insurer report, outreach, methods, manager kit
- /trackers — Pilot success tracker (CSV)

## Quick Start
1) Review `/docs/Human_Aware_Work_Vision_v2.pdf` and `/docs/Pilot_Packet_TOC.pdf`.
2) Open `/schemas/ingest_schema.json` and `/samples/sample_stream.jsonl` to see data shapes.
3) Configure rules in `/config/risk_rules.yaml` and run your sim/ingest.
4) Use `/trackers/pilot_success_tracker.csv` to log baseline and intervention metrics.
5) Adapt templates in `/templates` for your pilots and compliance needs.
