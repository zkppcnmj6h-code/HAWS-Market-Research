Subject: Pilot opportunity: predictive safety & team-only exposure analytics (privacy-first)

Hi [Name],
We're running a 60â€“90 day pilot of a lightweight safety twin that turns site and exposure signals into decision-grade insights (privacy-first, team-only).
What you get: real-time safety map, explainable alerts (heat/proximity/geofence), weekly KPIs, and an end-of-pilot decision memo.
Would you be open to a 20-min walkthrough next week?

Best,
[You]
