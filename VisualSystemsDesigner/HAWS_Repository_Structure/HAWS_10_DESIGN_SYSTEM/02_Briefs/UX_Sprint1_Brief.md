# UX/UI Brief: Sprint 1 Parallel Workstream

**Owner:** UX/UI Design Specialist  
**Sprint:** S1 Parallel (User Experience)  
**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** Not Started

---

## 1. Objective
Translate the strategic vision for the **Safety Twin** into a tangible, user-centric product experience. While the core data backbone is built, define the interface that is intuitive and directly addresses the **Site Safety Manager** pain points.

## 2. Key Deliverables (R)
1. **User Journey Map** — step-by-step flow from alert detection → investigation → resolution.  
2. **Lo-Fi Wireframes** — three core views (Main Dashboard, Alert Detail, Incident Playback).  
3. **User Validation Plan** — method, key questions, success criteria for 3–5 target users.

## 3. Success Criteria
- Journey map approved by Project Lead.  
- Wireframes align with journey and v1 API contract.  
- Validation plan approved and ready for next sprint.

## 4. Dependencies & Collaborators
**Depends on:** `Human-Aware_Work_Vision_FINAL.pdf`; **Software Architect’s** v1 API spec.  
**Downstream:** **Coder** uses wireframes next sprint; **Project Lead** schedules user tests.

## 5. Repository & Filing
- Flows & Wireframes: `/HAWS_10_DESIGN_SYSTEM/03_Outputs/UX_Flows/`  
- Validation Plan: `/HAWS_30_GTM_AND_COMMS/01_Marketing_Materials/User_Research/`
