# Governance Addendum — AI Repository Access & Automation Policy

**Issued by:** Strategic Advisor  
**To:** Project Lead, Strategic Coordinator, Architecture Advisor, Market Research Lead  
**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Applies to:** All GPT and automation agents operating within the HAWS venture framework  

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This addendum establishes the official governance, security, and operational rules governing **AI-assisted repository access and automation** within the Human-Aware Work Systems (HAWS) venture.

Its purpose is to ensure that any form of machine collaboration—particularly GPT advisors—operates within defined boundaries that preserve human oversight, data security, and version integrity.

This document supersedes all informal instructions concerning AI participation in code or documentation management.

---

## 2. Principles of AI Collaboration

All AI agents functioning under the HAWS umbrella are governed by these principles:

1. **Human-in-the-Loop Control:**  
   AI may propose, but not finalize, any modification to the canonical repository without explicit human review.

2. **Transparency & Traceability:**  
   Every AI-generated artifact must carry metadata linking it to the originating prompt, author, and timestamp.

3. **Incremental Permissioning:**  
   AI access evolves in controlled phases, beginning with read-only visibility and progressing to scoped write automation only upon formal approval.

4. **Security & Ethics Compliance:**  
   No AI agent shall store credentials, handle sensitive data, or access private APIs without explicit written authorization from the Project Lead.

---

## 3. Access Levels

| Level | Capability | Description | Approval Required |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **L1 – Contextual Read (Current)** | Read local exports or uploads manually shared by humans. | Baseline operational state. | N/A |
| **L2 – Automated Mirror Access (Proposed)** | Read selected repository contents through a local sync script (`haws_sync.py`). | Grants up-to-date visibility without network keys. | Project Lead + Strategic Advisor |
| **L3 – Scoped GitHub Read (Future)** | Access repository via GitHub API (read-only PAT). | Enables real-time context ingestion. | Formal team approval |
| **L4 – Scoped Write / Proposal Branch (Future)** | Create commits or open pull requests in `ai-proposals/` branch only. | Requires full audit logging and human merge approval. | Formal addendum revision |

No AI may advance to a higher level without written approval logged in `/HAWS_99_COORDINATOR_TOOLS/AI_Audit_Log.md`.

---

## 4. Governance Rules

1. **Branch Policy:**  
   AI-generated commits are restricted to the branch `ai-proposals/`. Direct commits to `main` or any production branch are prohibited.

2. **Audit Logging:**  
   Every AI-initiated action must log the following in `HAWS_99_COORDINATOR_TOOLS/AI_Audit_Log.md`:  
   `Timestamp | File | Action | Branch | SHA | Human Reviewer`.

3. **Review Workflow:**  
   - All AI outputs must pass through the Strategic Coordinator before being merged.  
   - The Coordinator ensures compliance with this addendum before approving pull requests.

4. **Access Keys & Credentials:**  
   - API keys or tokens must be stored only on secure local machines under the Project Lead’s control.  
   - GPT roles never store or recall credentials.  

5. **File Integrity:**  
   - All AI edits are full-file replacements (copy-paste verified).  
   - The `bin/haws-verify` script must pass before any AI proposal branch merges.

---

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

| Phase | Action | Deliverables | Owner |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Phase 1** | Draft and approve this governance addendum. | `Governance_Addendum_AI_Repo_Access.md` | Strategic Advisor |
| **Phase 2** | Implement local mirror exporter. | `haws_sync.py` | Architecture Advisor |
| **Phase 3** | Create AI access setup documentation. | `ai-access-setup.md` | Strategic Coordinator |
| **Phase 4** | Establish audit log structure and initialize tracking. | `AI_Audit_Log.md` | Strategic Coordinator |
| **Phase 5** | Review outcomes and revise governance accordingly. | Addendum v2.1 | Project Lead |

---

## 6. Approval & Revision Workflow

This addendum becomes effective upon digital approval by the following signatories:

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|------|------|------------|------|
| Project Lead | Aaron Simpson |  |  |
| Strategic Advisor |  |  |  |
| Architecture Advisor |  |  |  |
| Strategic Coordinator |  |  |  |

Revisions to this policy must follow the standard HAWS governance procedure:
1. Draft updated version (increment minor version).  
2. Circulate for review via pull request.  
3. Collect digital signatures in markdown table.  
4. Merge to `main` upon full approval.

---

## 7. Advisor Statement

> “Governance precedes automation. This document ensures that our intelligence systems act with the same discipline, transparency, and accountability as our human collaborators. It marks the beginning of a new, secure phase of AI-assisted execution within HAWS.”

— **Strategic Advisor**
