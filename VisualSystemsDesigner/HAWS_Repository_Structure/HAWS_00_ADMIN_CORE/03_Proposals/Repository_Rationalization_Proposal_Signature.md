# Proposal: HAWS Repository Rationalization Initiative (Signature Version)

**From:** Aaron Simpson, Project Lead  
**To:** Strategic Coordinator, Architecture Advisor, Strategic Advisor, UX/UI Design Specialist, Media Researcher, Coder  
**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** Pending Team Review  

---

## 1. Purpose

The HAWS repository has matured into a fully operational system supporting multiple workstreams. As we enter **Sprint-3 (Documentation & Governance)**, we must ensure the repository remains **lean, clear, and strategically aligned**.

This proposal outlines a structured plan to perform a **Repository Rationalization Audit** — a full review and cleanup of our project directory to eliminate redundancy, enforce standards, and enhance operational clarity.

---

## 2. Objectives

1. **Simplify Navigation** — Reduce cognitive load by ensuring every contributor can quickly locate relevant materials.  
2. **Eliminate Redundancy** — Identify and merge duplicate or outdated folders (e.g., `_HAWS_BACKUP`, older “VisualSystemsDesigner” copies).  
3. **Enforce Governance Standards** — Verify folder naming conventions align with the HAWS numbering schema (00–99) and contain valid metadata headers.  
4. **Separate Active vs. Archive** — Move deprecated files into a structured archive to preserve history without clutter.  
5. **Automate Future Hygiene** — Introduce a verification script and optional cleanup utility (`bin/haws-clean-structure.sh`) to maintain this discipline long-term.

---

## 3. Proposed Methodology

**Step 1 — Structure Export**  
Each contributor generates a lightweight snapshot (depth 3) of the current repository structure:

```bash
cd "/Users/aaronsimpson/Documents/Market Research/VisualSystemsDesigner/HAWS_Repository_Structure"
tree -L 3 > haws_tree_current.txt
```

If `tree` is not installed:
```bash
brew install tree
```

**Step 2 — Governance-Aligned Audit**  
The Strategic and Architecture Advisors analyze folder trees using the following criteria:

- **Workstream Consistency:** Ensure top-level folders follow the HAWS numbering schema.  
- **Redundant Paths:** Detect duplicate mirrors or outdated backups.  
- **Documentation Hygiene:** Ensure metadata headers exist and notices are current.  
- **Tooling Clarity:** Confirm scripts/templates reside under `HAWS_99_COORDINATOR_TOOLS`.  
- **Archive vs. Active:** Identify items ready for `_ARCHIVE/`.

Deliverable: a **Repository Rationalization Report** proposing for each folder: **Keep**, **Merge**, **Archive**, or **Delete**.

**Step 3 — Implementation Phase**  
Upon team approval:  
- Generate **non-destructive cleanup script** (`bin/haws-clean-structure.sh`).  
- Strategic Coordinator executes and validates.  
- Produce **File System Validation Log** under  
  `/HAWS_00_ADMIN_CORE/01_Master_Documents/admin/releases/`.

---

## 4. Expected Outcomes

- Unified folder structure and faster onboarding.  
- Reduced redundancy and fewer sync conflicts.  
- Clear governance boundaries enabling automated checks.  
- Documented change trail for traceability.  
- Sustainable hygiene via routine verification.

## 6. Next Actions (Post-Approval)

1. Coordinator issues audit instructions to all team members.  
2. Advisors compile findings and produce the **Rationalization Report**.  
3. Cleanup script generated and executed under validation protocol.  
4. New structure committed and version-tagged (e.g., `v1.3.0`).  
5. Change logged in `/HAWS_10_PROGRAM/04_Status/Change_Log.md`.
