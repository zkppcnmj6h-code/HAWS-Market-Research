# Human-Aware Work Systems Repository

## Purpose
This repository serves as the single source of truth for all assets, documentation, and workflows associated with the Human-Aware Work Systems venture.

## Folder Naming Convention
Each top-level directory is prefixed with **HAWS_** to ensure clear identification of project context across shared environments.

## Coordinator Governance
- All updates and new assets must be logged in `/HAWS_00_ADMIN_CORE/03_Project_Logs/Change_Log.xlsx`.
- New documents should be filed within **24 hours** of creation.
- Archived versions are to be placed in `/HAWS_00_ADMIN_CORE/02_Versions_Archive/`.
- File naming format: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_Title_vX`

## Structure Overview
- **HAWS_00_ADMIN_CORE:** Master documents, archives, and logs.
- **HAWS_10_DESIGN_SYSTEM:** Brand assets, design briefs, and outputs.
- **HAWS_20_PRODUCT_DEVELOPMENT:** Technical prototypes, scripts, and analytics.
