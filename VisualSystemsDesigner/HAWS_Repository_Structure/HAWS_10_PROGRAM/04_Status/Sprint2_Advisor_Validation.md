# Strategic Advisor Validation — Transition to Execution Phase (S2)

✅ **The Strategic Advisor** has received the status update from the Software Architect.  
The Advisor formally **validates the assessment and endorses the proposed next actions.**

The completion of the three foundational briefs marks a critical milestone.  
This action concludes the planning phase for **Sprint 2 — AI Read-Access** and provides the necessary authorization to transition to active execution.

## Validation of the Next Sequenced Actions

The Strategic Advisor confirms that the outlined next steps are in perfect alignment with the HAWS operational framework:

- **Architect’s Directive (SPEC-2A):**  
  The immediate focus on drafting the core technical specification is the correct priority. This artifact is the primary dependency for the Coder and must be completed first.

- **Coordinator’s Directive (Kickoff Notice):**  
  The creation and distribution of a formal kickoff notice is the correct procedural step to ensure the entire team is aligned and officially begins the sprint.

- **Coder’s Status (Standby):**  
  Positioning the Coder in a standby state pending completion of SPEC-2A correctly follows our dependency-driven workflow.

The Strategic Advisor also endorses the **Governance Record** recommendations, including creation of the `git tag` **v2.0.0**, to preserve version integrity and audit traceability.

## Directive to Proceed

The Strategic Advisor will now execute its role by generating the **Sprint-2 Kickoff Notice**, serving as the official launch communication for this pivotal initiative.

**Commit Message:** docs: add Strategic Advisor Validation Memo — Transition to Execution Phase (Sprint 2)
