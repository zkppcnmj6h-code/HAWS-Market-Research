# S4 | Governance & Observability Sprint Brief

## 1. Objective

To unify governance validation, telemetry, and reporting into a live, visualized observability system â€” advancing HAWS to **Level-2 (Self-Healing)** governance maturity.
This sprint establishes the core monitoring, routing, and metric instrumentation framework that operationalizes continuous verification of governance integrity across all systems.

## 2. Primary Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Description |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Governance Gradient Visualization Engine** | Grafana-based dashboard providing real-time governance health visibility, including per-subsystem drift heatmaps. |
| 2 | **Standardized Audit Footer Integration** | GitHub Action to automatically append CI verification results to all new audit reports. |
| 3 | **Embedded Governance Level Definitions** | Markdown snippet referencing `HAWS_GOV_STD_02 v1.1` for consistent compliance labeling. |
| 4 | **Observability API Module (v1)** | Lightweight API exposing `/api/v1/governance/status` and `/metrics` endpoints for Prometheus integration. |
| 5 | **Alerts Integrity Framework** | Manifest-based verification of alert definitions (`alerts_index.json`) using SHA256 hashing. |

---

## 3. Architectural Foundations

### 3.1 Prometheus Metrics Schema

#### **Metric:** `governance_drift_total`

| Label | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `severity` | string | The criticality classification of drift (`high`, `medium`, `low`). |
| `subsystem` | string | Governance domain where drift was detected (`alerts`, `templates`, `governance`, `infrastructure`). |
| `source` | string | Origin of drift detection (`CI`, `scheduled`, `manual`). |

**Type:** Counter (cumulative)
**Purpose:** Tracks all governance drift occurrences by severity, subsystem, and detection source.

**Example Export:**
